      <h2>Leash Training</h2>
      <p>eash training is a vital skill for any dog owner aiming to ensure their pet's safety and obedience during walks. The process involves gradually introducing the leash to the dog, starting indoors in a calm environment, and using positive reinforcement techniques like treats and praise to associate the leash with positive experiences. Slowly progressing to outdoor environments, owners can teach their dogs to walk calmly beside them without pulling or resisting. </p>
